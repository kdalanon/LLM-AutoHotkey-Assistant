### Editing prompts

Edit the `prompts` array in the script to add your own prompts.

```autohotkey
prompts := [{
    promptName: "Your Prompt Name",
    menuText: "&1 - Menu Text",
    systemPrompt: "Your system prompt",
    APIModels: "model-name",
    copyAsMarkdown: true,
    isAutoPaste: true,
    isCustomPrompt: true,
    customPromptInitialMessage: "Initial message that will show on Custom Prompt window",
    tags: ["&tag1", "&tag2"],
    skipConfirmation: true
}]
```

#### `promptName`

The name of the prompt. This will also be shown in the tooltip, `Send message to`, `Activate`, `Minimize`, and `Close` menus. In addition, this will also show in the Response Window title together with the chosen API model.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d4385b4-4abd-4c0d-8922-ab046cc38f38)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a06b87b6-2468-4166-a17f-a0bad27d9bb7)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f521d9b0-24cd-46da-9b73-2fe6fb8ec4f6)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/caa7a07a-b62f-48b2-8741-0a143f53ac99)

> [!NOTE]
> You can have duplicate shortcut keys for the prompts. Pressing the shortcut key will highlight the first prompt, and pressing the shortcut key again will highlight the second prompt. Pressing `Enter` afterwards will select the prompt and initiate the request.

#### `systemPrompt`

This will be the initial prompt and will set the tone and context of the conversation.

##### Splitting a long prompt into a series of multiple lines

Long prompts can be divided into new lines to improve readability.

```autohotkey
prompts := [{
    promptName: "Multi-line prompt example",
    menuText: "Multi-line prompt example",
    systemPrompt: "
    (
    This prompt is broken down into multiple lines.

    Here is the second sentence.

    And the third one.

    As long as the prompt is inside the quotes and the opening and closing parenthesis,

    it will be valid.
    )",
    APIModels: "
    (
    google/gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp:free
    )"
}]
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebd22b64-0c49-4ce2-a5b7-c10dd0b9f2e0)

#### `APIModels`

The API model that will be used to process the prompt.

Get your desired model from the [OpenRouter models website](https://openrouter.ai/models), click on the clipboard icon beside the name, and paste it here.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64f46a06-80ca-48b9-94bc-a57d3682a113)

Some example models:

- `openai/o3-mini-high`
- `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`
- `google/gemini-2.0-flash-001`
- `deepseek/deepseek-r1`

In addition, you can also append `:online` to *any* model so that it will have the capability to do a web search. Check [here](https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/web-search) to learn how it works.

- `openai/o3-mini-high:online`
- `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet:online`
- `google/gemini-2.0-flash-001:online`
- `deepseek/deepseek-r1:online`

To enable multi-model functionality, you can specify different API models, separating them with a comma and a space:

```autohotkey
prompts := [{
    promptName: "Deep thinking multi-model custom prompt",
    menuText: "&1 - Deep thinking multi-model custom prompt",
    systemPrompt: "You are a helpful assistant. Follow the instructions that I will provide or answer any questions that I will ask. My first query is the following:",
    APIModels: "perplexity/r1-1776, openai/o3-mini-high, anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet:thinking, google/gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp:free",
    isCustomPrompt: true,
    customPromptInitialMessage: "This is a message template."
}]
```

You can also enter them into new lines for better readability:

```autohotkey
prompts := [{
    promptName: "Deep thinking multi-model custom prompt",
    menuText: "&1 - Deep thinking multi-model custom prompt",
    systemPrompt: "You are a helpful assistant. Follow the instructions that I will provide or answer any questions that I will ask. My first query is the following:",
    APIModels: "
    (
    perplexity/r1-1776,
    openai/o3-mini-high,
    anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet:thinking,
    google/gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp:free
    )",
    isCustomPrompt: true,
    customPromptInitialMessage: "This is a message template."
}]
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0a7158a-b1ee-4cf5-959a-696c561b6d25)

After selecting the prompt with multiple API models, it will enable the `Send message to`, `Activate`, `Minimize`, and `Close` menu options after pressing the backtick hotkey.

Since this app uses [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) service, you get access to the [latest models](https://openrouter.ai/models) as soon as they're available.

> [!TIP]
> Feeling overwhelmed by the number of models to choose from? Take a look at [OpenRouter.ai's ranking page](https://openrouter.ai/rankings) to discover the best models for each task. You can also find benchmarks across various models at [LiveBench.ai](https://livebench.ai/#/).

##### Auto Router

Your prompt will be processed by a meta-model and [routed to one of dozens of models](https://openrouter.ai/openrouter/auto), optimizing for the best possible output. To use it, just enter `openrouter/auto` in the `APIModel` field.

#### `copyAsMarkdown: true`

Setting `copyAsMarkdown: true` will enable the `Copy` button in the Response Window to copy content in Markdown format. This is especially useful for responses that need markdown content such as codes for programming.

If you’d rather copy the response as plain text or HTML-formatted text (default behavior), simply remove this setting.

#### `isAutoPaste: true`

Setting `isAutoPaste: true` will automatically paste the model's response in Markdown format. Remove this if you don't need auto-paste functionality.

> [!NOTE]  
> The app will automatically disable the Auto Paste functionality if more than one model is set, and will show the Response Window instead.

Default behavior of copied content between `isAutoPaste: true` and `Copy`:

| Setting             | Format        |
|----------------------|---------------|
| `Copy` button from the Response Window | HTML          |
| `isAutoPaste: true`  | Markdown      |

#### `isCustomPrompt: true`

Setting `isCustomPrompt: true` will allow the prompt to show an input box to write custom prompts. Remove this if you don't need Custom Prompt functionality.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/951a3133-bf21-44e6-8959-b98ab26bbbb1)

##### `customPromptInitialMessage`

An optional message that you can set to be displayed when the Custom Prompt window is shown. Remove this if you don't want to show a message whenever you open the Custom Prompt.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7aeb1a40-8bbd-4aae-bf44-fb417c5f366c)

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8f70927-2544-4c8e-a856-b4569d89263e

> [!TIP]
> You can also split a long message into a series of multiple lines.
> See [Splitting a long prompt into a series of multiple lines](#Splitting-a-long-prompt-into-a-series-of-multiple-lines) for more info.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Make sure to add a comma at the end of the line before the Auto Paste, Custom Prompt, `copyAsMarkdown`, etc. functionality:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04ad392f-0f6d-45c0-b00b-00d0e4414109)

#### `tags`

Enabling this feature will sort and group the prompts by their tags.

For example, this will show `&1 - Gemini, GPT-4o, Claude` to both `&Custom prompts` and `&Multi-models` sub menus:

```autohotkey
prompts := [{
    promptName: "Multi-model custom prompt",
    menuText: "&1 - Gemini, GPT-4o, Claude",
    systemPrompt: "System prompt",
    APIModels: "google/gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp:free, openai/gpt-4o, anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet",
    isCustomPrompt: true,
    customPromptInitialMessage: "How can I leverage the power of AI in my everyday tasks?",
    tags: ["&Custom prompts", "&Multi-models"]
}, {
    promptName: "Auto-paste custom prompt",
    menuText: "&5 - Auto-paste custom prompt",
    systemPrompt: "You are a helpful assistant. Follow the instructions that I will provide or answer any questions that I will ask.",
    APIModels: "google/gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp:free",
    isCustomPrompt: true,
    isAutoPaste: true,
    tags: ["&Custom prompts", "&Auto paste"]
}]
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c931782-0937-4a10-a26a-2fe7f22272aa)

#### `skipConfirmation: true`

Setting `skipConfirmation: true` will skip confirmation messages when closing the following windows:

- Custom prompt
- Chat
- Chat with specific prompt
- Response Window

## 📣 Share prompts and settings

Do you have prompts and settings you'd like to share? [Check here](https://github.com/kdalanon/LLM-AutoHotkey-Assistant/discussions/7) to share your prompts!

## 🔒 Privacy policy

The app does not collect logs, prompts, or copied text. It simply bundles up the conversation between you and your chosen API model and sends the request to [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/). See their privacy policy [here](https://openrouter.ai/privacy). Adjust your OpenRouter privacy settings [here](https://openrouter.ai/settings/privacy).

4 temporary files are written to the `temp` folder (`C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Temp`) after selecting a prompt for each API model:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a465eee3-de7d-4a20-9c89-e9e62e985318)

- `chatHistoryJSONRequest` contains the conversation between you and the model.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/619fb67d-1ff4-44d3-9150-c50ff852368d)

- `cURLOutput` contains the model's response.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d66e709b-679a-44b9-bb80-80d1b9a1d72c)

- `responseWindowData` contains the data needed for Response Window to display and interact with the model's response.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8909cc50-7fe9-434a-ba40-fa2ae5556bce)

- `cURLCommand` contains the cURL command that will be executed to the API.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16daecd5-4b46-46ae-b375-951d8c1857d5)

These files will be created after you select a prompt and will be deleted when any of the following actions are performed:

- Pasting the response when `isAutoPaste: true` is set
- Pressing the `ESC` key _after_ selecting a prompt but _before_ receiving the model's response (for example, if the Response Window has not yet opened)
- Closing the Response Window

## 💬 Frequently-asked questions

### Can I use my Anthropic/OpenAI/Google/Other provider's API?

Yes, you can use your own keys, but there is a caveat: You _must_ use OpenRouter's API keys in the app, _then_ configure your provider's API settings on the [Integrations](https://openrouter.ai/settings/integrations) page. This ensures OpenRouter will prioritize using your key.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/506c2cf7-f056-43e2-b418-740254482e24)

More information [here](https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/byok).

### How much is the usage cost per prompt?

The usage costs varies per model. The model's input/output token price is indicated below its name.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67ac3208-4f82-4267-b967-923c80cfc09d)

> [!TIP]
> Search for [free models](https://openrouter.ai/models?q=free) to avoid any charges on your credits when using the app. These free models are particularly helpful when you want to explore the app’s features or experiment with different models.

### Are there any rate limits?

See [OpenRouter's documentation](https://openrouter.ai/docs/api-reference/limits) for their limits.

> [!NOTE]
> Negative credit balance: If your account has a negative credit balance, you may receive 402 errors, even when using free models. Add credits to bring your balance above zero to resolve this and regain access.

### Can I connect it with my local AI?

I'm uncertain if it will work, as I don't have a local AI setup on my machine to test it myself. However, it's highly likely to work if your local AI uses the same format as the `OpenAI SDK`. OpenRouter relies on the `OpenAI SDK` for request processing. I followed the [OpenRouter documentation](https://openrouter.ai/docs/quickstart) to configure the app to connect to their API.

To understand how the app sends and receives requests through the OpenRouter API, open the `Config.ahk` file in the `lib` folder. If you successfully set up the app to connect to your local LLM, please let me know, and I will update this information.

### Can I run the app using a portable installation of AutoHotkey?

Yes, you can modify the `LLM AutoHotkey Assistant.ahk` script to point to your portable `AutoHotkey64.exe` file. Just change this line:

```autohotkey
Run("lib\Response Window.ahk " "`"" dataObjToJSONStrFile)
```

to

```autohotkey
Run('"C:\path\to\AutoHotkey64.exe" "' A_ScriptDir '\lib\Response Window.ahk" "' dataObjToJSONStrFile '"')
```

Thanks to [@WhazZzZzup25](https://github.com/kdalanon/LLM-AutoHotkey-Assistant/issues/1#issuecomment-2693062034) for testing this out.
